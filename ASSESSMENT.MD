# Marks 100/100
## General Remarks
So this is obviously a very advanced implementation which was not expected for this assignment. If I am to take this at its face value, this is outstanding work.
However, this does point to the possibility that there is at least one member in the group who has a stronger background in nodejs than the rest of the teammates. 
As long as all of you can demonstrate that you know the implementation inside out, I am ready to let this slide as a very well done assignment. But do make sure you are prepared in your final presentation of project 4 to demonstrate that you all understand the various advanced techniques used in this assignment (like jwt, middleware, mongoose, express validator etc)
